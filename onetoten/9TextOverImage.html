<p>What is the Internet?<br>
The internet is simply a network of computers that communicate with each other to send and receive data (information). Each of these computers on the internet can be distinguished and located by a unique number called an IP Address. An IP Address looks something like this: 168.212.226.204<br>
<br>What is the Web?<br>
The Web is a subset of the internet. Like every other computer network out there, the Web is made up of two main components: the web browser client and the web server.<br>
<br>What is HTML?<br>
HTML is a markup language used to format/structure a web page, CSS is a design language that you use to make your web page look nice and presentable.<br>
<br>What is CSS?<br>
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and you use it to improve the appearance of a web page. By adding thoughtful CSS styles, you make your page more attractive and pleasant for the end user to view and use.<br>
<br>What is JavaScript?<br>
Now, if HTML is the markup language and CSS is the design language, then JavaScript is the programming language.<br>
<br>How to Put HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Together<br>
Together, we use these three languages to format, design, and program web pages.
    And when you link together some web pages with hyperlinks, along with all their assets like images, videos, and so on that are on the server computer, it gets rendered into a website.
    This rendering typically happens on the front end, where the users can see what's being displayed and interact with it.
    On the other hand, data, especially sensitive information like passwords, are stored and supplied from the back end part of the website. This is the part of a website which exists only on the server computer, and isn't displayed on the front-end browser. There, the user cannot see or readily access that information.</p>
